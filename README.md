# ML_food_detection_and_food_recommended_System
High calorie intake has proved harmful worldwide,as it has led to many diseases 
However,dieticians have deemed that a standard intake of number of calories is essential to maintain the right balance of calorie content 
in human body
So, This project is based on Food detection and recommendation through machine learning,wherein from height and weight parameter, we will recommend wether the particular food calorie harmful for your body or not
This particular Model shows 78% in accuracy we test data on 101 food category, This Project is also used in restaurants where it detects
the calorie level of the regular customer and recommend them on basis of there previous order observations and if the consumer is new it will save the customer details and the food details which they ordered,into database
Likewise they work for both regular and new customers

    - calorie_data.csv: data consist of calories of 101 food categories with weights in grams
    - recmd_food_image.py: file which take image to prediction
    - predict_food_live.py: live food detecion
    - haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml: open cv front face classifier
    - Some random images
